# Blockchain-Based Smart City Quantum Infrastructure

A comprehensive blockchain infrastructure for managing quantum-enabled smart city systems using Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

This project implements a decentralized infrastructure for smart cities that leverages quantum computing capabilities and blockchain technology to create secure, efficient, and optimized urban systems.

## Architecture

### Smart Contracts

1. **Infrastructure Verification Contract** (`infrastructure-verification.clar`)
    - Validates quantum city systems and infrastructure components
    - Manages infrastructure registry and verification status
    - Tracks performance scores and quantum compatibility

2. **Quantum Network Contract** (`quantum-network.clar`)
    - Manages quantum communication infrastructure
    - Handles network topology and node connections
    - Monitors bandwidth, latency, and network performance

3. **Service Integration Contract** (`service-integration.clar`)
    - Connects quantum services with city operations
    - Manages service registry and integrations
    - Handles traffic management, energy grid, emergency response, and more

4. **Security Protocol Contract** (`security-protocol.clar`)
    - Ensures quantum infrastructure security
    - Manages access controls and threat assessments
    - Implements quantum-resistant security protocols

5. **Performance Optimization Contract** (`performance-optimization.clar`)
    - Optimizes quantum city services and resource allocation
    - Monitors performance metrics and efficiency scores
    - Executes automated optimization cycles

## Features

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Stacks blockchain development environment
- Clarity CLI tools
- Node.js and npm for testing

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd quantum-city-infrastructure
   \`\`\`

2. Install dependencies:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`

3. Run tests:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm test
   \`\`\`

### Deployment

Deploy contracts to Stacks blockchain:

\`\`\`bash
# Deploy infrastructure verification contract
clarinet deploy contracts/infrastructure-verification.clar

# Deploy quantum network contract
clarinet deploy contracts/quantum-network.clar

# Deploy service integration contract
clarinet deploy contracts/service-integration.clar

# Deploy security protocol contract
clarinet deploy contracts/security-protocol.clar

clarinet deploy contracts/performance-optimization.clar
\`\`\`

## Usage Examples

### Register Infrastructure
\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .infrastructure-verification register-infrastructure
"quantum-sensor-001"
"environmental-sensor"
true)
\`\`\`

### Create Quantum Network Node
\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .quantum-network register-quantum-node
"node-001"
u1
"downtown-district"
u1000)
\`\`\`

### Register City Service
\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .service-integration register-service
"traffic-mgmt-001"
"Traffic Management System"
u1
true
u8)
\`\`\`

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests using Vitest:

\`\`\`bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test infrastructure-verification.test.js

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
\`\`\`

## Security Considerations

- All contracts implement owner-only functions for critical operations
- Quantum-resistant encryption protocols are supported
- Multi-level access controls with principal-based authentication
- Threat monitoring and automated response capabilities

## Performance Metrics

The system tracks various performance indicators:
- Infrastructure verification scores
- Network bandwidth utilization
- Service integration efficiency
- Security threat levels
- Resource allocation optimization
